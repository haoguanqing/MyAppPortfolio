## My Android App Portfolio

Project 0 of the Android Developer Nanodegree on Udacity!

Design and build a layout in Android Studio for an app that showcases my app portfolio. Each button represents an app that I am going to build in the Nanodegree program.

================================
**June 9 update**

*A few modifications including:*

--Put all titles and texts in strings.xml for easier maintenance. Put colors in colors.xml.

--Use button names directly with text = ((Button)view).getText().toString()
Instead of using static strings to make toasts.

--Eliminate the time delay between two toasts.

--Add the landscape layout.
